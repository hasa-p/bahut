# The bahut project

**BAHUT** (a French word of unknown origin), a portable coffer or chest, with a rounded lid covered in leather, garnished with nails, used for the transport of clothes or other personal luggage,â€”it was, in short, the original portmanteau.[[1]](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bahut)

This is a personal project for a self-hosted file server using Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS, Docker, Nextcloud, and Cloudflare Tunnel.
